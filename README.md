## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters (like this one!)

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new PROJECT_NAME https://github.com/youngboy/weimi-starter
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd PROJECT_NAME/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

    Open the the `PROJECT_NAME` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
